## Our Story

Schauer-Mayhew designs (SMd.) is a creative partnership between Addam Mayhew and Bryan Schauer, blending interior design and photography to elevate spaces and experiences.

## Addam Mayhew

From a young age, Addam knew they wanted to work in design, with interior design as the happy mix of their deep love of art and architecture. They enjoy transforming a client’s needs and wants into reality. When Addam is not working, you can find them at an estate sale/antiquing, visiting museums, hiking, biking, and gardening. Addam and Bryan live in the Kingman Park neighborhood of northeast DC. Their lemon beagle, Teagan, sits on the arm of the sofa near a window and acts as mayor of their street.

## Bryan Schauer

Bryan’s always had an interest in computers, initially in hardware, but quickly moving to software during grad school. For the past decade, he’s been working in DevOps, managing cloud infrastructure and security. He found his way behind a camera after taking digital photography and darkroom classes at Capitol Hill Arts Workshop. When Bryan isn’t in front of a screen, you can find him practicing yoga/mindfulness, visiting museums, hiking, biking, or walking the dog. Bryan and Addam live in the Kingman Park neighborhood of northeast DC along with their lemon beagle, Teagan.

## Why SMd.?

Together, Addam and Bryan offer a unique blend of design and visual storytelling, helping clients realize their vision from concept to completion.
