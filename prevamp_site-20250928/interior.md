From a young age, Addam knew they wanted to work in design, with interior design as the happy mix of their deep love of art and architecture. They enjoy transforming a clientâ€™s needs and wants into reality. When Addam is not working, you can find them at an estate sale/antiquing, visiting museums, hiking, biking, and gardening. Addam and Bryan live in the Kingman Park neighborhood of northeast DC. Their lemon beagle, Teagan, sits on the arm of the sofa near a window and acts as mayor of their street.
